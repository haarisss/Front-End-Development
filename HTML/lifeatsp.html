However, this happens on a day to day basis. Although I get  exhausted by the end of the day, I enjoy lessons because I like my course and I enjoy the activities and tasks we do.My favourite subject is Funamentals of Programming as I really like coding.Classes are fun as my friends and I will always chat and joke around to survie the long hours.</p><br><br>

I've already joined SPAI and Entrepreneurship Club which are event-based CCAs so I only attend if there is a webinar or worshop I'm interested in. I joined SPAI as I want to learn  how to code better and I want to learn programming languages ahead of my peers. I joined Entrepreneurship Club because I see opportunites that will help me when I decide to kickstart a business. I am still waiting for the bowling trials. I am interested in joining bowling but the trials are delayed due to Covid-19. I also look forward to joining pool in my second year.</p><br><br>

                    <p class="text-justify">In my first year, I'll be learning what everyone else in School of Computing will be learning. My subjects are Fundamentals of Programming, Fundamentals of Computing, Mathematics,Critical And Analytical Thinking, Communications for Project Effectiveness, Education and Career Guidance and lastly Front-End Web Development. Honestly, I thought there will be only a few subjects but  I guess that's just how it is. The second year is when it gets exciting as I will learn machine learning, a subject for AI. My third year will of course be focused on internship. Want to know more about AI? Watch Tony Spark explaining in the video.</p><br><br>
