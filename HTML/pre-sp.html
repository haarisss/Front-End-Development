          <p class="text-justify">When I was previously pursuing GCE O Levels in <a href="https://ngeeannsec.moe.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Ngee Ann Secondary School</a>,there was always much competition as expected. Throughout my 4 years, it has always been a challenge to top the class, forget about topping the cohort. There was always a lot of pressure and mostly due to the good reputation of the school that they want to continue upholding. It's not a surprise as whenever I infom someone that I'm in Ngee Ann, they seemed impressed and complimented me for being in a good school. When i was in lower secondary, classes were always fun especially when I'm working with my friends. We had many funny bonding memories. Before heading to upper secondary, I chose the triple science stream as my subject combination for GCE O Levels. Classes  were dull most of the times but fun sometimes which is not a surprise because we were closer to O Levels and thus classes were more serious.Life was even harder in upper secondary due to my subject combiantion which requires a lot of commitment and there were multiple times when i felt like giving up but I believed in myself, persisted and eventually scored decently in O Levels. I took part in many academic competitions throughout the 4 years such as <a href="https://sms.math.nus.edu.sg/index.php/singapore-mathematical-olympiad-smo/" target="_blank">Singapore Mathematical Olympiad</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/singapore-polytechnic/singapore-polytechnic-debate-open-2017/810894922399871/" target="_blank">Singapore Polytechnic Debate Open</a> as well as <a href="https://snic.org.sg/index.php/event/sjcho" target="_blank">Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad</a>. I really enjoyed camps and my favourite was the Advanced Leadership Training Camp.</p>

          <p class="text-justify">I was in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/photography.nas/?hl=en" target="_blank">Photography Club</a> in secondary School and the only reason I chose it was because it was only once a week andI can just relax most of the time. Soon, I started liking photography and I enjoyed cca sessions to the extent that I wished CCA was twice a week. CCA was really fun because of the members in the CCA who are very friendly. I also has a good relationship with the teachers in charge. I made a lot of friends in CCA. In secondary 3 , I was elected the Vice President of Photography Club which is why I went for the leadership camp and I loved it not only because it was at Sentosa but because it was really fun and enriching. Being vice president was fun and tiring, I had to come up with CCA plans and also ensure the members are doing what they are supposed to. I got scolded a lot but I also had a really good time. I took part in many photography competitions and I was also one of the trainers for Monochrome Photography for the <a href="https://sypc2019submission.wixsite.com/home" target="_blank">Singapore Young Photographers Convention</a> at Anglo Chinese Secondary International.</p>
